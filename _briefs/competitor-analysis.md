```

### Key Findings

1. **Design gap is massive.** Most B2B gym equipment sites look like they were built in 2012. Only Precor and Fit Supply have modern designs. This is GymForge's biggest opportunity.

2. **Pricing transparency varies widely.** Wholesale buyers want to compare, but most sites force a phone call. A hybrid model (category-level pricing tiers + quote form for custom orders) could differentiate.

3. **Mobile optimization is an afterthought** for most competitors. B2B buyers increasingly research on mobile during facility walkthroughs.

4. **Trust signals are underused.** Few competitors effectively use stats, certifications, or social proof. Most rely on brand name alone.

5. **Content is king but neglected.** Long-form SEO content exists but is poorly formatted. No competitor does educational content well (blog, guides, calculators).
